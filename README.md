Challenge Report 

Summary for schhol budget and grades.
According to this data it seems to be true that with higher budgets comes higher test scores across all student grade levels. Schools either district or charter that had a higher budget per student showed higher average test scores in math and reading.

Summary for school size and grades 
While sorting through the data provided I found that the size of the school also effects the grades of the students. Smaller schools yeilded higher test grades compared to large schools. 

Summary for school type and grades
This data was pretty straight forward. Charter schools had overwhelming higher testing scores over district schools.

Conclusion
In conclusion, there are many variables that affect the the test scores in students. According to the data the best schools to send your kids to are smaller charter schools. This could be do to the fact that students may get more one on one training and help with the testing, homework and learning tasks. It is easier to help smaller groups of students rather than larger groups of students. Although this could be true there are also a lot more variables to consider when rating schools including where is the school located, the general wealth of the public in the area, etc.
